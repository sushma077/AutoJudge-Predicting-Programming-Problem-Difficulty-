Hiding an animal\\n    of this size is difficult: if you use a lot of space, it is\\n    obvious that you are hiding something from your friends. Hence,\\n    you want to use as little space as possible to hide the\\n    kangaroo.\\nWhen the kangaroo was placed against the wall, you took a\\n    black and white picture of the animal. Looking around in the\\n    house, the only tools you found to hide the kangaroo with were\\n    empty tin cans. The dimensions of the tin cans correspond with\\n    $2 \\\\times 2$ pixels in the\\n    picture and these cans cannot overlap. So, you can make a\\n    cangaroo and if someone asks why you have cans in the\\n    shape of a kangaroo, you simply say it is a bad joke of\\n    yours.\\nThe position of each can has to exactly correspond to a\\n    block of $2\\\\times 2$\\n    pixels in the picture, and they cannot be shifted or rotated to\\n    only partially cover some pixels. Furthermore, cans cannot\\n    float in the air, so every can has to be supported either by\\n    the floor, which is just below the bottom row of the picture,\\n    or by another can, for which at least one of the left and right\\n    half must directly rest on another can. The structure does not\\n    otherwise need to be balanced.\\nWhat is the minimum number of cans needed to hide the\\n    kangaroo?\\n\",\n          \"You have sent a robot out into the forest, and it has gotten\\n    lost. It has a sensor that will detect all the trees around\\n    itself regardless of any occlusions, but unfortunately in this\\n    forest, all trees look alike. You do have a map of all trees in\\n    the forest, represented as $(x,y)$ points. Conveniently, since\\n    this used to be a tree farm, all trees are at integer\\n    coordinates, though not all coordinates are occupied. The\\n    robot\\u2019s sensor tells you the $x$ and $y$ distance to each tree within\\n    range, relative to the front of the robot. However, the robot\\n    is heading in an unknown direction relative to the map, so each\\n    sensor reading is given as a tuple of (distance to the right of\\n    the robot, distance forward of the robot) and either value can\\n    be negative since the robot can sense in all directions.\\n    Helpfully, the robot will always place itself at integer\\n    coordinates and aligned to the positive or negative\\n    $x$ or $y$ axis, and will never be at the\\n    same location as a tree. Can you find out where the robot\\n    is?\\n\",\n          \"Method ringing is used to ring bells in churches,\\n    particularly in England. Suppose there are $6$ bells that have $6$ different pitches. We assign the\\n    number $1$ to the bell\\n    highest in pitch, $2$ to\\n    the second highest, and so on. When the $6$ bells are rung in some order\\u2014each\\n    of them exactly once\\u2014it is called a row.

Unfortunately, the laws of physics\\n    place a limitation on any two consecutive rows; when a bell is\\n    rung, it has considerable inertia and the ringer has only a\\n    limited ability to accelerate or retard its cycle. Therefore,\\n    the position of each bell can change by at most one between two\\n    consecutive rows.\\nIn Figure\\u00a01, you can see the pattern of a non-ideal\\n    performance, where bells only change position by at most\\n    one.\\nGiven $n$, the number\\n    of bells, output an ideal performance.
